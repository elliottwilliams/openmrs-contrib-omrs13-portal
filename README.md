A landing page for Unifi access points used at the [2013 Implementers Meeting](http://events.openmrs.org).
Here's how it'll work:

1. Each OMRS13 attender will have a network key given to them when they arrive.
2. They'll get this page the first time they attempt to connect a given device to our network.
3. They'll enter their network key, and the Unifi access points will associate their MAC address with their access token.
4. They are connected (w00t).
